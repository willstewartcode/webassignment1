        <h2><b>//&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>Introduction & Education</h2>
        <p><b>Hello! My name is Will Stewart.</b> I am a junior at APSU stuying <b>Internet & Web Technology</b>
          and <b>Mobile Software Technology</b>. I studied graphic design at <b>Lee University</b> before
          transferring to APSU after discovering a love for coding I developed in my free time. At the time
          of writing, I would say I am fairly knowledgeable on <b>HTML</b> and <b>CSS</b>, but have yet to spend time making
          things with JavaScript (though I have looked into the basics). I am also taking courses in Java, which
          will allow me to code apps for mobile devices and other platforms.

        <h2><b>//&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>Hobbies</h2>
        <p>Even though I am no longer studying graphic design, I still find it
          fun to design something every once in a while, and I know that those
          skills will be helpful in web and app design. I also enjoy photography,
          especially taking macro shots and photographs of nature and wildlife. Aside from
          those things, I love to spend time with my family watching TV shows, movies, and playing
          video games. We also go on hikes and visit sightseeing places from time to time.
