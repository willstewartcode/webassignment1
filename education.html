  <p>I started my college career in 2018 at Lee University
    studying graphic design. Design was something I enjoyed for several
    years before studying it in college, and it still is. However, after a couple
    of years, I decided that while I enjoyed graphic design, it wasn't something
    I wanted to build a career out of.
  </p><br>
  <p>I began looking for something else that I would
    enjoy as a career and that would also make use of my design skills,
    and discovered that web design/development was a great fit. I had already
    played around with HTML and CSS before when trying to build an online portfolio
    of my design work, so I went online to start learning more about it and found that
    I really enjoyed coding websites. I ended up choosing APSU as the place to continue
    my education because of the school's extensive computer science programs, several of
    which are offered online. I am currently in my second semester here at APSU, and am working
    towards a major in Computer Information Technology - Internet & Web Technology with a minor
    in Mobile Software Technology.
  </p><br>
  <p>I have really enjoyed my time at APSU so far, and look forward to learning
    more about web and app development.
