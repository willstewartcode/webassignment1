      Last year, I built my own PC. It was initially built as a workstation, but I have
      since upgraded it for gaming. It was a really fun experience and it has been quite interesting
      learning how to troubleshoot different problems.

    <li>I am the first in a few generations of my family to have red hair.</li>
    <li>I have a twelfth great grandmother who was one of the 19 that were hanged during the Salem Witch Trials.</li>
    <li>I have never broken any bones (that I know of).</li>
    <li>I have never been out of the US, but hope to go to many more places in the future.</li>
