  <p>I was born and raised in Cleveland, TN, and have lived here my entire life. My family consists of my parents as well as two younger brothers and two dogs.
    Sawyer, the oldest of my younger brothers, is currently 15 and is in his first year of
    high school. Ben, my other brother, is 12 and is in his first year of middle school.
    Our dad works at a non-profit called City Fields, in which he runs a program that helps people
    get jobs. Our mom is the librarian at E.L. Ross Elementary School.

  <p>Our two dogs, Becca and Boomer, could not be more opposite. We rescued
    Becca, a miniature schauzer, in 2009 when she was just 4 years old. She's fairly
    reserved but still has plenty of energy in her. We got Boomer in 2016 when he was just
    8 weeks old. He is a daschund mix, but we're not sure what the other breed is. He is very
    hyper-active and loves to run and play outside.
